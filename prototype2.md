Can you review the nostr.md and also the prototype.md attached for the conversation context. 

Please write a prototype but address issue #5 - non nostr users should be allowed to add an entry and the ownership will be given to the relay pubkey. 

Issue #6. - only allow a maximum of 5 editors. They can be selected by the user or they can be the primary managers of the relay or the relay pubkey. 

Use the improved Directory Entry Structure 

Issue #1 - Use more than one WoT relay, allow a default and let the user pick any extras if they want to have one. 

Issue #2 - Allow Individual editor permission or up to 5 other editors they can designate or allow the relay pubkey to own the event if they are not a nostr user

I believe #3 Category Tag Inconsistency already has a proposed fix. 

Ignore #4
